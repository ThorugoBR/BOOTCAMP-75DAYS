#### Ingredients ####

    - 500 g de chicken breast
    - a pinch salt if wanted
    - a pinch ground pepper if desired
    - 3 garlic cloves
    - 1 onion
    - bread crumbs 
    - wheat flour 
    - 1 egg
    - oil (to fry if desired)

#### Steps ####

Put inside of a blender the chicken breast, a pinch of salt add the ground pepper if desired ,the garlic cloves  and the onion

Blend all until the mixture became uniform

Take a bunch of the mixture and mold it in the desired way.

To bread you will need to separate the breadcrumbs, the egg and the wheat flour into 3 containers.

So the processed chicken doesn't stick to your hands, put a little margarine on them.

Spread the nuggets in the flour, then the egg and then the breadcrumbs (repeat this procedure twice).

The nuggets will be ready to be fried or baked according to your preference.
